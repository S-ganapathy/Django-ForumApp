# Django Forum App

This is a **Forum application** built with Django as part of my practice work during the probation period. The tutorial source is currently unknown, but the project helped me explore key Django concepts such as user interaction, threaded discussions, permissions, and working with relational models.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The Forum app allows users to register, create posts, reply to topics, and engage in discussions across different boards or categories. It's designed to mimic the basic structure of an online forum (like Reddit or Stack Overflow on a smaller scale).

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Django 3.x**
- **SQLite** (for development)
- **Bootstrap** (for UI)
- **Django Messages Framework** (for alerts & notifications)
- **Custom middleware and permissions** (where applicable)

## ðŸš€ Features

- User registration and login
- Boards/Categories with multiple topics
- Threaded discussions with post replies
